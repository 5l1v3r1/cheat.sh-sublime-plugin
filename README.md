# cheat.sh-sublime-plugin

Please note that this is simply a proof of concept of the Sublime Plugin for "cht.sh". New features are intended 
to be added soon. Please feel free to give it a spin in the meanwhile, and write in your requests, suggestions and ideas.

## How To Install

1. Download the project, and copy the CheatSheet folder in the Packages folder of your installation. You can 
open the packages folder from "Preferences -> Browse Packages".
2. Then using the Package Control plugin, install the missing dependencies. To do this, you must open the 
Command Palette from "Tools -> Command Palette" and write "Package Control: Satisfy Dependencies". 
3. You can open the console from "View -> Show Console" to check for any errors.

## How to Use

1. Open your source file. The extension of the source file should indicate the programming language (eg. .py for python).
2. Write your query, eg. "append file". Select and press the key sequence to send request to "cht.sh". On Linux the key combination
is "Ctrl + Shift + b". On MacOS, the key combination is "Cmd + b".
3. The query will then be replaced by the code generated from "cht.sh".
