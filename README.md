## How To Install

Hint : You can open the Packages folder from "Preferences -> Browse Packages".

Command Palette from "Tools -> Command Palette" and write "Package Control: Satisfy Dependencies". 
3. You can open the console from "View -> Show Console" to check for any errors.

Meanwhile, we are working on publishing this plugin using Package Control, which will make it easy to install and update. Stay tuned for updates on this.

## How to Use
